## Minion Docker files

This repository provides OpenNMS Minions as docker images.

It is recommended to use `docker-compose` to build a service stack.
You can provide the Minion configuration in the `.minion.env` file.

## Requirements

* docker 17.03+
* docker-compose 1.8.0+
* git
* optional on MacOSX, Docker environment, e.g. Kitematic, boot2docker or similar

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/opennms-forge/docker-minion.git
cd docker-minion
docker-compose up -d
```

The Karaf Shell is exposed on TCP port 8980.
Additionally the ports to receive Syslog (514/UDP) and SNMP Traps (162/UDP) are exposed as well.

To start the Minion and initialize the configuration run with argument `-f`.

You can login with default user *admin* with password *admin*.
Please change immediately the default password to a secure password described in the [Install Guide].

## Dealing with Credentials

To communicate with OpenNMS credentials for the message broker and the ReST API are required.
There are two options to set those credentials to communicate with OpenNMS.

***Option 1***: Set the credentials with an environment variable

It is possible to set communication credentials with environment variables and using the `-c` option for the entrypoint.

```
docker run --rm -d \
  -e "MINION_LOCATION=Apex-Office" \
  -e "OPENNMS_BROKER_URL=tcp://172.20.11.19:61616" \
  -e "OPENNMS_HTTP_URL=http://172.20.11.19:8980/opennms" \
  -e "OPENNMS_HTTP_USER=minion" \
  -e "OPENNMS_HTTP_PASS=minion" \
  -e "OPENNMS_BROKER_USER=minion" \
  -e "OPENNMS_BROKER_PASS=minion" \
  opennms/minion -c
```

*IMPORTANT:* Be aware these credentials can be exposed in log files and the `docker inspect` command.
               It is recommended to use an encrypted keystore file which is described in option 2.

***Option 2***: Initialize and use a keystore file 

Credentials for the OpenNMS communication can be stored in an encrypted keystore file `scv.jce`.
It is possible to start a Minion with a given keystore file by using a file mount into the container like `-v path/to/scv.jce:/opt/minion/etc/scv.jce`

You can initialize a keystore file on your local system using the `-s` option on the Minion container using the interactive mode.

The following example creates a new keystore file `scv.jce` in your current working directory:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/keystore opennms/minion -s

Enter OpenNMS HTTP username: myminion
Enter OpenNMS HTTP password:
Enter OpenNMS Broker username: myminion
Enter OpenNMS Broker password:
[main] INFO org.opennms.features.scv.jceks.JCEKSSecureCredentialsVault - No existing keystore found at: {}. Using empty keystore.
[main] INFO org.opennms.features.scv.jceks.JCEKSSecureCredentialsVault - Loading existing keystore from: scv.jce
```

The keystore file can be used by mounting the file into the container and start the Minion application with `-f`. 

```
docker run --rm -d \
  -e "MINION_LOCATION=Apex-Office" \
  -e "OPENNMS_BROKER_URL=tcp://172.20.11.19:61616" \
  -e "OPENNMS_HTTP_URL=http://172.20.11.19:8980/opennms" \
  -v $(pwd)/scv.jce:/opt/minion/etc/scv.jce \
  opennms/minion -f 
```
